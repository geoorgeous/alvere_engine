# Alvere

Alvere is intended to be a single-library game engine which provides an API for creating 3D and 2D games. It is currently in the very early stages of development.

There exists a [test application](https://github.com/george-mcdonagh/alvere_engine/tree/master/alvere/alvere_application) in the repo which is being used as a sandbox for the Alvere engine.
